# What is NetBios?

### NetBIOS - Network Basic Input/Output System

Created by IBM but can be found on Microsoft client Operating Systems.

NetBIOS on the network is an indication that there are old operating systems on the network.

New Windows Operating Systems don't support it!

### Default Ports

* NetBIOS Name Service: UDP/137
* NetBIOS Datagram Service: UDP/138
* NetBIOS Session Service: TCP/139
